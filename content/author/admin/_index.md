I am working with the UMR “Water Management, Uses, Actors” (G-EAU). I am mainly interested in economic instruments leading to a better governance of natural resources, especially water. I am currently secunded to the Centre for Environmental Economics and Policy in Africa (CEEPA), at the Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences of the _University of Pretoria (UP)_.

My research program focuses on:

1. The economic value of hydro-ecosystems,
2. The impacts of water allocation policies (efficiency, equity) and the potential implications for the food and energy sectors, and
3. The economic and institutional instruments conducive to a reduction in water consumption by the different sectors, especially agriculture
